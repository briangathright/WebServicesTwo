# WebServicesTwo

Brian Gathright - August Meyer - Nema Nemati

This is our repository for Webservices Project 3. It is also hosted on Heroku at https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/ . 

Brief Architecture Info

We used Hibernate and a Postgres Database as well as deployment on Heroku and hosted on GitHub. We then added Apache CXF and use a Jetty Runner as our server. 

We set up our architecture to be similar to your sample project (similar package naming scheme). 

We couldn't get the client working, some kind of issues with heroku. But if you go to https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/ you can view our services. 

You can test our getAlls by going to the below links.

https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/services/billinginfoservice/billinginfo

https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/services/reviewservice/review
https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/services/sellerservice/seller

You can also retrieve individuals by doing for example  https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/services/productservice/product/1

(check the getAlls to see how high the id values go for individual retrieve.) 

Please see code documentation and UML for more information. Please let us know if you need anything else.
