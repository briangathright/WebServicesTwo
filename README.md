# WebServicesTwo

Brian Gathright - August Meyer - Nema Nemati

This is our repository for Webservices Project 3. It is also hosted on Heroku at https://damp-reef-8180.herokuapp.com/ . 

The frontend is located at: https://github.com/august-of-wind/COMP388FrontEnd

Brief Architecture Info

We used Hibernate and a Postgres Database as well as deployment on Heroku and hosted on GitHub. We then added Apache CXF and use a Jetty Runner as our server. 

We set up our architecture to be similar to your sample project (similar package naming scheme). 

Project update: we used the sample Link architecture
